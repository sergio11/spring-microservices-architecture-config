# Define the port where the API gateway server would be running

  port: 8765

# The OAuth2 server definition that would be used to send the authorization requests to
authserver:
    hostname: localhost
    port: 8899
    contextPath: userauth
# Define the routes which determine what URL are serviced by what applications.
# The application/services are defined in the bootstrap.yml file of individual applications
# using the spring.application.name property.

# Note that we don't proxy the calls to the authorization server. The reason being that 
# Spring cloud security would need to secure the api gateway before it can route the 
# requests using zuul
zuul:
  routes:
    user-webservice: /api/user/**

# Define the Eureka server that handles service registration
eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: ${EUREKA_ENDPOINT}

# Define settings for Single-Sign-On with OAuth2; this means that we need to relay the OAuth token 
# to the subsequent resources that are proxied by the Zuul api gateway.

# The home definition tells us to allow anonymous access (secure: false) to the static resources that
# are accessed through the Zuul proxy.

# Remaining properties are used by the OAuth2 SSO to determine where the authorization server is and
# what client crendentials to use to access that server.
spring:
  oauth2:

      userInfoUri: http://${authserver.hostname}:${authserver.port}/${authserver.contextPath}/me
      preferTokenInfo: false 
# The userInfoUri is used to authenticate the user so that SSO token can be relayed forward. It needs to either be
# a physical endpoint (defined using userInfoUri) OR can be bypassed if you use a JSON web token (JWT) that stores
# information about grants and authentication in the token itself.

# Note that the "/user" endpoint needs to provide the principle of the logged in user (/me endpoint)
